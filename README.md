### IO vs CPU Bound
An I/O-bound problem spends most of its time waiting for external operations, like a network call, to complete. A CPU-bound problem, on the other hand, does few I/O operations, and its overall execution time is a factor of how fast it can process the required data.

#### IO Bound
Probably best to use asyncio or threading, since setting up processing more resource-heavy

### CPU Bound
Use multi-processing
